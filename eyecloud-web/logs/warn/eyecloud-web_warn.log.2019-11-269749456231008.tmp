[] 2019-11-26 12:18:25: WARN o.s.c.a.ConfigurationClassPostProcessor:381 - Cannot enhance @Configuration bean definition 'disconfConfig' since its singleton instance has been created too early. The typical cause is a non-static @Bean method with a BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor return type: Consider declaring such methods as 'static'.
[] 2019-11-26 12:18:26: WARN o.s.c.a.ConfigurationClassEnhancer:353 - @Bean method DubboConfig.annotationBean is non-static and returns an object assignable to Spring's BeanFactoryPostProcessor interface. This will result in a failure to process annotations such as @Autowired, @Resource and @PostConstruct within the method's declaring @Configuration class. Add the 'static' modifier to this method to avoid these container lifecycle issues; see @Bean javadoc for complete details.
